How do you select elements in the DOM? 
ANS. You can use methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), and getElementsByClassName() to target elements in the HTML structure.

What are event listeners? 
ANS. These are functions that listen for specific actions on elements, such as clicks, mouse movements, or keyboard inputs, using addEventListener().

Explain event delegation. 
ANS. It's a technique where a single event listener is placed on a parent element to handle events triggered by its children, using the bubbling phase of events.

How do you prevent default behavior in JavaScript? 
ANS. Use event.preventDefault() to stop a browser’s default action, like preventing a link from navigating or a form from submitting.

What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ANS. var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared.
     let: Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared.
     const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

How does bubbling and capturing work in events? 
ANS. Events travel in two phases: capturing (top-down) and bubbling (bottom-up). You can control which phase handles the listener with a third true/false argument.

How do you add and remove classes in JavaScript? 
ANS. Use methods like classList.add(), classList.remove(), and classList.toggle() to manipulate an element’s styling dynamically.

What is closure in JavaScript? 
ANS. A closure is when a function retains access to variables from its parent scope, even after the parent function has finished executing.

Explain arrow functions. 
ANS. Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and do not have their own this context. Example: const greet = () => "Hello"

What is the difference between == and ===?
ANS. ==: Compares values with type conversion.
     ===: Compares values and types directly—more strict and reliable.
